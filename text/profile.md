I am a PhD student at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/), supervised by [Peter Orbanz](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~porbanz/) and [Morgane Austern](https://sites.google.com/view/morganeaustern/). I study mathematical structures of large stochastic systems that emerge in machine learning settings, and the associated theory and algorithms for estimation, prediction and uncertainty quantification. I am particularly interested in settings with high-dimensional data and structured correlations.

I organise the [Foundations and Landmarks reading group](https://foundations-landmarks.notion.site/) with [Max Hird](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-hird-366a30b4/), a biweekly reading group based in London, reviewing foundational papers in probability and statistics. 

I am visiting the [LIPS group at Princeton](https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/) this spring, where I work with [Ryan P. Adams](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rpa/) on invariance learning.

Prior to my PhD, I received my [Bachelor and Master in Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) from [Magdalene College](https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university).

I also do [nonprofit work, software development, and a bit of cooking](/non-maths) on the side.

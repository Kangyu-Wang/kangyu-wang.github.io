# Projects

- 2020. [**Statslab**]((http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/) and [**Computer Laboratory, Cambridge**](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/). I wrote my master essay on a review of the theoretical foundations on neural tangent kernels, examined by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and [Rajen Shah](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/).

- 2019. [**Cambridge Image Analysis Group**](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis) and [**Statslab, Cambridge**](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/). I worked on reviewing the Regularisation by Denoising framework in the context of image inverse problems. I was supervised by [Sam Power](https://sites.google.com/view/sp-monte-carlo), [Sebastian Lunz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5I31e7AAAAAJ&hl=fr), and [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html).

- 2019. [**Hackbridge**](https://hackbridge.io/). I worked on multi-object 6d vpose prediction from 2d images with [Dominik A. Kloepfer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-a-kloepfer), supervised by [Nicolai Wojke](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=i8BCLogAAAAJ&hl=de).

- 2018. [**Statslab, Cambridge**](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/). I worked on outlier detection in time series of graphs and extreme value theory, supervised by [Yi Yu](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/yu/) and [Jenny Wadsworth](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~wadswojl/).

Hi! I am a PhD candidate at [Department of Philosophy, Logic & Scientific Method](https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/), the London School of Economics, supervised by [Dr Campbell Brown](https://philpeople.org/profiles/campbell-brown) and [Dr Kieran Oberman](https://philpeople.org/profiles/kieran-oberman) and previously by [Prof Johanna Thoma](https://johannathoma.com/).

I mainly work on ethics, political philosophy, decision theory and practical reason, and philosophy of economics. I also have projects on the meaning in life, philosophy of AI, and philosophy of finance. 

I received an LL.B. in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Renmin University of China and an MSc in Philosophy and Public Policy from LSE. I was a visiting PhD student at the Australian National University and then at University of Toronto in the second half of 2023, sponsored by [Prof Katie Steele](https://katiesteelephilosophy.weebly.com/) and [Prof Sergio Tenenbaum](https://www.sergiotenenbaum.org/homepage.html) respectively, and at Rutgers-New Brunswick in Spring 2024, sponsored by [Prof Mike Otsuka](https://sites.rutgers.edu/michael-otsuka/people/michael-otsuka/).

I am a co-organiser of [the LSE Choice Group](https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/choice-group/). I am also a Research Affiliate at [The Machine Intelligence and Normative Theory (MINT) Lab](https://mintresearch.org), Australian National University. I reviewed for *Synthese*.

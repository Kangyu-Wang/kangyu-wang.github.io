## Projects prior to PhD

- 2020\. *[Statslab]((http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/) and [Computer Laboratory, Cambridge](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/)*. I wrote my master essay on a review of the theoretical foundations on neural tangent kernels, examined by [Neil Lawrence](https://inverseprobability.com/) and [Rajen Shah](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rds37/).

- 2019\. *[Cambridge Image Analysis Group](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/cia/cambridge-image-analysis) and [Statslab, Cambridge](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/)*. I worked on reviewing the Regularisation by Denoising framework in the context of image inverse problems. I was supervised by [Sam Power](https://sites.google.com/view/sp-monte-carlo), [Sebastian Lunz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5I31e7AAAAAJ&hl=fr), and [Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html).

- 2019\. *[Hackbridge](https://hackbridge.io/)*. I worked on multi-object 6d vpose prediction from 2d images with [Dominik A. Kloepfer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-a-kloepfer), supervised by [Nicolai Wojke](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=i8BCLogAAAAJ&hl=de).

- 2018\. *[Statslab, Cambridge](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/)*. I worked on outlier detection in time series of graphs and extreme value theory, supervised by [Yi Yu](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/yu/) and [Jenny Wadsworth](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/~wadswojl/).

As a [Teochew Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_people) who grew up in China and spent my teenage years in Singapore, I get easily overexcited when talking about our [food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_cuisine), culture, and the [Teochew dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teochew_dialect) which is considered [dying](https://pacificties.org/when-language-means-family-tca-at-ucla/#:~:text=Teochew%20is%20considered%20a%20dying,popular%20as%20Mandarin%20or%20Cantonese.) among younger generations outside China.

I also co-founded [CamPlus](https://www.facebook.com/CamPlus.2016) with [Kristen Yang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kristen-dilan-yang-b5a4b5102/?locale=en_US), a student-run Cambridge-based media channel to connect the residential and university Chinese communities in Cambridge, with the hope to facilitate idea exchange and discourse about Chinese issues and culture.

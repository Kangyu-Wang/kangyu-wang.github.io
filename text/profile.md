I am a PhD student at the [Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit at UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/gatsby/), supervised by [Peter Orbanz](http://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~porbanz/). My [research](/research) interests revolve around developing theoretical tools from statistics and probability to improve understanding of machine learning. My current work focuses on invariance and stochastic algorithms.

Prior to my PhD, I receive my [Bachelor and Master in Mathematics](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) from [Magdalene College](https://www.magd.cam.ac.uk/), [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/about-the-university).

I organise the [Foundations and Landmarks reading group](https://foundations-landmarks.notion.site/) with [Max Hird](https://www.linkedin.com/in/max-hird-366a30b4/), a biweekly reading group based in London, reviewing foundational papers in probability and statistics. 

I also do [nonprofit work, software development, and a bit of cooking](/non-maths) on the side.

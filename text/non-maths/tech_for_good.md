I am a firm advocate for tech for good: I believe that technological advances should be coupled with responsible and careful assessments of their implications, and should be actively harnessed to address social issues around the world.

Since 2016, I have been volunteering with an amazing global nonprofit called [Bridges for Enterprise (BfE)](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/), which provides pro-bono consulting services to social enterprises in the developing world. I founded the [Technical Advisory branch](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/) of BfE's flagship incubation programme and the internal [Technology Division](https://tech.bridgesforenterprise.com/). I was BfE's Global Head of Technology during 2020-2022, overseeing analytics, software development and cloud infrastructure, while facilitating non-technical work from product strategies, project management to tech partnerships. See my [interview](https://medium.com/bridges-for-enterprise/meet-kevin-huang-bfe-global-head-of-technology-655763fa072d) in 2021 for what we do and a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrgImNwIw0) I gave at [Bytes of Good Live](https://bytesofgood.org/) in 2021 on BfE's take on tech for good. For any BfE-related inquiries, please drop me an email at **kevin[dot]huang[at]bridgesforenterprise[dot]com**.

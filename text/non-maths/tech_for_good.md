I am a firm advocate for tech for good: I believe that technological advances should be coupled with responsible and careful assessments of their implications, and should be actively harnessed to address social issues around the world.

Since 2016, I have been volunteering with an amazing global nonprofit called [Bridges for Enterprise (BfE)](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/), which provides pro-bono consulting services to social enterprises in the developing world. I founded the [Technical Advisory branch](https://www.bridgesforenterprise.com/) of BfE's flagship incubation programme and the internal [Technology Division](https://tech.bridgesforenterprise.com/). Currently, I am BfE's Global Head of Technology overseeing analytics, algorithms, software development, DevOps and security. See a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SrgImNwIw0) I gave at [Bytes of Good Live](https://bytesofgood.org/) on BfE's take on tech for good.

If you want to inquire about BfE, or just want to chat about tech for good and technology in the developing world in general, feel free to drop me an email at **kevin[dot]huang[at]bridgesforenterprise[dot]com**.
